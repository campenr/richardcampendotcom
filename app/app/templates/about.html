            <h1>Hi!&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‹</h1>

            <p>
                Iâ€™m Richard Campen.
            </p>

            <p>
                I spend my days working as a web developer (mostly Python/Django + js), and building/maintaining infrastructure (AWS, gcloud), automating as much as I can (Terraform, Ansible, Docker).
            </p>

            <p>
                In a past life I was a microbiologist / bioinformatician, with a PhD in molecular Microbiology, generating, processing, and analyzing large biological datasets.
