# Hi!&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Richard Campen.

I spend my days working as a web developer (mostly Python/Django + js), and building/maintaining infrastructure (AWS, gcloud), automating as much as I can (Terraform, Ansible, Docker).

In a past life I was a microbiologist / bioinformatician, with a PhD in molecular Microbiology, generating, processing, and analyzing large biological datasets.

This website is a central repository of content I have created or contributed to.
